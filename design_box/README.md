## Features

Flutter has an extremely versatile SDK, however sometimes we just need 10% of the features to do 90%
of the work. I created this widget to regroup features I thought added the most to designing
while still keeping it as simple as possible.

- The **Box** makes it easier to read and write widgets by simplifying parameters used often.
    - **Shadow**, **Border**, **Radius**, **Inkwell** and **Gradient** are flattened on the same
      level.
    - Added shortcut functions for **Shadow**, **Border**, **Radius** and **Gradient**
      initialization.
- This is intended to be used by design systems as a low-level building block in order to create
  more complex elements.

## Getting started

Clone the repo & add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  orange_design_box:
    path: "../orange_design_box"
```

## Usage

```dart

const box = Box(
  width: 40,
  height: 40,
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
  margin: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
  radius: boxRadius(10),
  border: boxBorder(Colors.white, width: 2),
  shadow: boxShadow(4),
  gradient: boxGradient(
    begin: Alignment.topRight,
    end: Alignment.bottomLeft,
    beginColor: Colors.deepOrange,
    endColor: Colors.deepPurple,
  ),
  onPressed: () {},
);
```
